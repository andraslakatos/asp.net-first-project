# asp.net-first-project
My first asp.net university project.

It is an C# ASP.NET project, with .NET 6 and uses a reational SQL Database.

The goal was to make a webpage on which you can make orders and a desktop client where you can see the orders, complete them and create new items.

The project is not the nicest or most polished, because I only focused on the assigments requirements.
