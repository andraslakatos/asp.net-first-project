# asp.net-first-project
My first asp.net university project.

The goal was to make a webpage on which you can make orders and a desktop client where you can see the orders, complete them and create new items.

The project works with an SQL database trough the SQLServer NuGet package.

The project is not the nicest or most polished, because I only focused on the assigments requirements.
